# Netwatcher
Sometimes, my wlan decides to be shitty. This script detects when wlan goes bad and restarts the interface.

## Installation:

1. Put colors.sh somewhere in your $PATH
2. Put this script somewhere in your $PATH

## Usage: run this script as root:

    sudo netwatcher
    
If things don't work the way you like, try changing some values at the top of the file.

## TODO:

* Put all comments in Englsh
* revise and clean the code up
